Calculate an estimated monthly mortgage payment

== Description ==

This [Mortgage Calculator](https://www.mortgageratemath.com/ "Mortgage Calculator") plugin allows your users to calculate their estimated monthly mortgage payment. The calculator can be used as both a widget and a shortcode and offers multiple customization options.

Fields can be enabled and disabled as well as have their default values set.

Customizable fields and values include:

<ul>
	<li>Loan Amount</li>
	<li>Down Payment</li>
	<li>Interest Rate</li>
	<li>Loan Term</li>
	<li>Annual Property Tax</li>
	<li>Annual Home Insurance</li>
	<li>Annual HOA Fee</li>
	<li>Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</li>
</ul>

Note: Disabled fields will still be used in the calculations with their set default values. This way you can disable displaying certain fields, but still take them into account for more accurate calculations.
